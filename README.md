# Red Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the quality of red wine and develop a model to predict wine quality. By examining the chemical properties of wine, the project seeks to identify key ingredients influencing taste and quality.

## Files
- `ProjectWineJordanFuchs.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the analysis, machine learning model development, and visualization of the red wine data.
- `ProjectJordanFuchs.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Getting Started
To explore the analysis and run the notebook, you will need the following:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Relevant Python packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `lightgbm`

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jfuchs01/wine_quality.git
cd wine_quality
```

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn lightgbm
```

### Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook to view and run the analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook ProjectWineJordanFuchs.ipynb
```

## Project Insights
- Utilized various data visualization techniques (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps) to explore relationships between wine properties.
- Developed classification models including K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Light GBM to predict wine quality.
- Light GBM achieved the highest accuracy in classifying the quality of red wine based on the analyzed features.


## Acknowledgments
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle's red wine quality dataset related to Portuguese "Vinho Verde".
- Thanks to all the contributors who have helped in refining the analysis and enhancing the predictive model.
